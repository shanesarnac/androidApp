Created By: Shane Sarnac, Fadhil Suhendi and Dan Wallin

---------------------------
DESCRIPTION OF APPLICATION

Grade Calculator for Android is designed to calculate a user's grade for a given Subject, based on the weights of the Categories of each Subject and the Assignments within each Category. The user interface and grade calculator functionality are not currently linked. 

---------------------------
REPO ORGANIZATION

- Documentation Folder: This folder contains all of the files generated by Doxygen, including the interactive html files that show the   documentation of the java source code.

- Source Folder: This folder contains the java source code that is used to run the grade calculator functionality as well as the test file. 

- androidApps, .gradle/1.12/taskArtifacts, and .idea Folders: These folders contain the necessary files for the Android user interface and also the java activity for running both the program and user interface.

---------------------------
BUILDING / RUNNING THE CODE

- In order to run the java source code for the grade calculator, navigate to the Source directory and then type "javac GradeCalculator.java" and then "java GradeCalculator". This will run the grade calculating portion of the code.

- To run the user interface portion of the code, import all files from the androidApps, .gradle/1.12/taskArtifacts , and .idea Folders into Android Studio, click the play button in the tool bar, then choose a running device (if using an android emulator) and the user interface will then appear as it would on an android user's mobile device.  

- To view the Doxygen documentation, navigate to Documentation/html and then open the index.html file with a web browser.

---------------------------
TESTING THE CODE

In order to test the code, compile the Grade_Calculator_Tests.java file by typing "javac Grade_Calculator_Tests.java" and then type "java Grade_Calculator_Tests" this will successfully run all of the test cases.
